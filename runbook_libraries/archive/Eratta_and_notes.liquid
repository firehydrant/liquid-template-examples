*Variable test*
Figure out if for more complicated collections of strings should be composed in a variable and passed in?

{% assign variable_test = 'I am a variable evaluating: {{incident.name}}!' %}

This is the variable test: {{variable_test}}

*Date Format Play*
Created at: {{incident.created_at | date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"}}
Now: {{"now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" }}

:arrow_down I don't think any of these 'format' attribuetes work (or they didn't without a comma?)
Long: {{ incident.created_at | date: , format: 'long' }}
Short: {{ incident.created_at | date: , format: 'short' }}
Default: {{ incident.created_at | date: , format: 'default' }}

*If elsif else experiment*
{% if incident.duration }
This shouldn't render. (if)
{% elsif %}
This probably won't render without a value in the elsif (elsif)
{% else %}
I'd be shocked if this didn't render (else)
{% endif %}
